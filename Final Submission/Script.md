# Introduction and Problem Statement

"Electric vehicles are seen as the future of sustainable transportation, but they face critical challenges that limit their potential. Issues like battery inefficiency, motor performance problems, and poor user experience contribute to battery degradation and range anxiety. These limitations prevent EVs from becoming the mainstream choice. Our project, BEAM, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced AI solutions to improve battery health, extend lifespan, and optimize motor efficiency."

# BEAM’s Modes: Eco and Performance

"To tackle these challenges and provide a superior driving experience, BEAM offers two advanced modes: Eco Mode and Performance Mode. Both modes are powered by intelligent algorithms designed to optimize battery and motor performance while ensuring the best balance of efficiency and driving satisfaction."

# Simulation with User Input via Streamlit

"To demonstrate BEAM’s capabilities, we’ve built an interactive simulation using Streamlit. Instead of relying on live sensor data, we take user input to simulate real-world conditions. Users can input variables like driving speed, route distance, and battery charge, and the system will simulate how BEAM optimizes energy usage in Eco and Performance Modes. This allows users to experience the benefits of BEAM’s intelligent algorithms and see how they affect battery health and motor performance in real-time."

# Current-Generation Eco Mode

"Today’s EV eco modes prioritize efficiency by heavily restricting throttle power, which sacrifices performance. Drivers are left with slower acceleration and reduced driving pleasure. While it saves energy, it doesn’t provide a balanced solution."

# BEAM’s Eco Mode

"Our approach is inspired by the movement of the sidewinder snake, which minimizes contact and moves efficiently through wave propagation. BEAM’s AI detects battery cell modules within a pack and uses them selectively, ensuring minimal energy usage. This approach extends battery life, improves thermal performance, and enhances fault tolerance. With BEAM’s Eco Mode, drivers enjoy better efficiency without losing performance. Additionally, real-time alerts and notifications are displayed to keep drivers informed about battery usage, thermal conditions, and suggestions for optimal driving."

# Current-Generation Performance Mode

"In traditional performance modes, EVs prioritize high acceleration by increasing power output. While this provides a thrilling experience, it drains the battery faster, generates excessive heat, and leads to inefficiency."

# BEAM’s Performance Mode

"Our advanced performance mode is powered by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm. BEAM dynamically adjusts power output and cooling in real time. It optimizes motor performance while managing speed and distance based on route data. The model is trained to minimize energy spikes, reduce wastage, and ensure smooth performance. Drivers experience high-speed performance without compromising battery health or thermal stability. Alerts and notifications in this mode guide drivers by showing energy usage trends, thermal alerts, and recommendations for maintaining peak performance."

# LLM-Powered Monitoring

"To enhance user experience, BEAM integrates a fine-tuned LLaMA 8B model. This system monitors battery health, performance metrics, and driving conditions, providing real-time insights. It gives voice alerts and notifications to guide drivers, ensuring they stay informed about critical updates and driving tips. Alerts are mode-specific, providing relevant insights for either Eco or Performance mode."

"BEAM delivers significant improvements in battery efficiency, lifespan, and user experience. Drivers benefit from extended battery life, reduced energy waste, and a seamless blend of performance and efficiency. By combining AI-driven innovation with practical EV solutions, BEAM sets a new benchmark for electric vehicles, making them more sustainable, efficient, and user-friendly."
