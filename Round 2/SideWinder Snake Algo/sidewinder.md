Approach Using Sidewinder for Battery Optimization
    Adaptive Charging Path: Similar to the snake's movement, the algorithm would prioritize charging sections with the most immediate need, avoiding overloading by shifting to other sections if a section is near full charge or if charging could lead to overheating.
    Sectional Balancing: With the Sidewinder’s "zigzag" traversal, the algorithm could balance the load across sections, moving between sections based on priority needs (e.g., undercharged sections first) while avoiding sections that could cause strain due to current state or temperature limits.
    Consumption Management: By dynamically adjusting which sections are used for output during high-demand periods, the algorithm could maintain balance and prevent overloads, particularly by alternating between sections when one is under high load or approaching critical levels.
    Health Monitoring and Maintenance: Battery health could be maintained by rotating usage among sections, ensuring that no single section is disproportionately drained or stressed. The algorithm can monitor each section’s usage patterns, adjusting priorities to give "rest periods" to heavily used sections.
