# Introduction and Problem Statement
Electric vehicles are seen as the future of sustainable transportation,Volkswagen, a pioneer in innovation, is also at the forefront of this movement, with its ID.4 electric car recently launched in India.but they face critical challenges that limit their potential. Issues like battery inefficiency, motor performance problems, and poor user experience contribute to battery degradation and range anxiety.These limitations prevent EVs from becoming the mainstream choice. Our project, BEAM, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced AI solutions to improve battery health, extend lifespan, and optimize motor efficiency.

# BEAMâ€™s Modes: Eco and Performance
"To tackle these challenges and provide a superior driving experience, BEAM offers two advanced modes: Eco Mode and Performance Mode. Both modes are powered by intelligent algorithms designed to optimize battery and motor performance while ensuring the best balance of efficiency and driving satisfaction."
