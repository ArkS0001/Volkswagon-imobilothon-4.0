# Introduction and Problem Statement
Good Morning Respected Leaders and Esteemed members
Electric vehicles are seen as the future of sustainable transportation,Volkswagen, a pioneer in innovation, is also at the forefront of this movement, with its ID.4 electric car recently launched in India.but they face critical challenges that limit their potential. Issues like battery inefficiency, motor performance problems, and poor user experience contribute to battery degradation and range anxiety.These limitations prevent EVs from becoming the mainstream choice. Our project, BEAM, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced AI solutions to improve battery health, extend lifespan, and optimize motor efficiency.

# BEAM’s Modes: Eco and Performance
"To tackle these challenges and provide a superior driving experience, BEAM offers two advanced modes: Eco Mode and Performance Mode. Both modes are powered by intelligent and bio inspired algorithms designed to optimize battery and motor performance while ensuring the best balance of efficiency and driving satisfaction."

Ayush Verma Will explain the workflow

# architecture ---VERMA
The process starts with sensor data from EVs and human feedback, which are preprocessed to extract key features. This data trains an AI model to learn patterns and optimize vehicle performance. A fine-tuned LLM enhances these insights, delivering personalized recommendations and alerts. Metaheuristic and reinforcement learning algorithms, like the Sidewinder Snake Algorithm for battery efficiency and PPO for motor performance, ensure real-time optimization. The system continuously monitors and improves through feedback loops, providing reports, actionable insights, and voice alerts via a user-friendly interface for optimal EV performance.

# Simulation with User Input via Streamlit
"To demonstrate BEAM’s capabilities, we’ve built an interactive simulation using Streamlit. Instead of relying on live sensor data, we take user input to simulate real-world conditions.This allows users to experience the benefits of BEAM’s intelligent algorithms and see how they affect battery health and motor performance in real-time.

# Current-Generation Eco Mode

"Today’s EV eco modes prioritize efficiency by heavily restricting throttle power, which sacrifices performance. Drivers are left with slower acceleration and reduced driving pleasure. While it saves energy, it doesn’t provide a balanced solution."

# BEAM’s Eco Mode
"Our approach is inspired by the movement of the sidewinder snake, which minimizes contact and moves efficiently through wave propagation. BEAM’s AI detects batterycell modules within a pack and uses them selectively, ensuring minimal energy usage. This approach extends battery life, improves thermal performance, and enhances fault tolerance. With BEAM’s Eco Mode, drivers enjoy better efficiency without losing performance. Additionally, real-time alerts and notifications are displayed to keep drivers informed about battery usage, thermal conditions, and suggestions for optimal driving."

# Current-Generation Performance Mode

"In traditional performance modes, EVs prioritize high acceleration by increasing power output. While this provides a thrilling experience, it drains the battery faster, generates excessive heat, and leads to inefficiency."

# BEAM’s Performance Mode
"Our advanced performance mode is powered by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm. BEAM dynamically adjusts power output and cooling in real time. It optimizes motor performance while managing speed and distance based on route data. The model is trained to minimize energy spikes, reduce wastage, and ensure smooth performance. Drivers experience high-speed performance without compromising battery health or thermal stability. Alerts and notifications in this mode guide drivers by showing energy usage trends, thermal alerts, and recommendations for maintaining peak performance."

# LLM-Powered Monitoring
"To enhance user experience, BEAM integrates a fine-tuned LLaMA 8B model. This system monitors battery health, performance metrics, and driving conditions, providing real-time insights. It gives voice alerts and notifications to guide drivers, ensuring they stay informed about critical updates and driving tips. Alerts are mode-specific, providing relevant insights for either Eco or Performance mode."

Now bhaskar will tell about the results of our project

# graph-BHASKAR
Analyzing the results,The Wave-like strategy, also known as Sidewinder, excels in maintaining lower battery temperatures compared to the Linear strategy, reducing overheating risks while enhancing battery life. It supports extended range by covering more distance per cycle and retains a higher battery charge for improved longevity. On the other hand, Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO, ensures superior thermal management by dynamically keeping EV temperatures low. It optimizes battery usage better than traditional rule-based methods, retaining a longer charge. PPO also adjusts speed dynamically based on road conditions, enabling EVs to cover longer distances efficiently on the same charge. Both approaches highlight innovative steps toward EV performance and sustainability.

# tech stack-VERMA
Talking about the tech stack of our project, we are using the GYM library to create a simulated environment and learning agent. For fine-tuning the Llama model, we utilize the GROQ library by calling its API. Additionally, we employ Stable-Baselines3, which provides pre-built reinforcement learning algorithms. For text-to-speech generation, we use the Transformers library with Microsoft's SpeechT5 model. Finally, we leverage the Datasets library, which offers a seamless way to access and manage datasets for training machine learning models.

# LIMITATION-VERMA
Talking about the challenges and limitations, our project is currently running in a controlled simulated environment. However, in the real world, sensor data can be more complex and variable. Secondly, our project relies on standard charging stations, but using non-standard stations could impact battery life and performance. Thirdly, unpredictable user inputs and driving habits may affect the accuracy of BEAM recommendations. Lastly, the limited computational power of car hardware could restrict the full implementation of BEAM in real-time scenarios.
