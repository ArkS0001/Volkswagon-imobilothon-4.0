CO2 fleet emissions

We use the strategic indicator of CO2 fleet emissions in Europe and the United States to evaluate the effectiveness of our measures to reduce CO2 emissions when driving our vehicles.

The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet in the EU (EU27+2) (from 2022 including Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average of 119 g CO2/km (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure – WLTP)1 in the reporting period in accordance with the statutory measurement bases. The statutory target is 122 g CO2/km (WLTP)1. The Volkswagen Group thus more than met the EU’s CO2 fleet target. All figures are subject to confirmation of CO2 data within the scope of official publication by the European Commission. The targets are expected to be tightened as from 2025 (subject to publication in the EU Official Journal): the European Commission has thus set a target of a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions, which corresponds to a CO2 target of less than 105 g CO2/km for our new passenger car fleet in the EU. A reduction of 55% has been defined for 2030, equivalent to a CO2 target of less than 55 g CO2/km. We assume that our new passenger car fleet in the EU will meet the target for 2025 and more than meet the target for 2030. A CO2 reduction target of 100% for passenger cars has been set for 2035.

The Volkswagen Group’s new light commercial vehicles fleet in the EU emitted an average of 193 g CO2/km (WLTP)1 in the reporting period according to the statutory measurement bases. The statutory target is 199 g CO2/km (WLTP)1. The Volkswagen Group thus more than met the EU’s CO2 fleet target. All figures are subject to confirmation of CO2 data within the scope of official publication by the European Commission. The targets are expected to be tightened as from 2025 (subject to publication in the EU Official Journal): the European Commission has thus stipulated a 15% reduction of CO2 emissions, which corresponds to a CO2 target of less than 184 g CO2/km for our new light commercial vehicle fleet in the EU. A reduction of 50% has been defined for 2030, equivalent to a CO2 target of less than 108 g CO2/km. We assume that our new light commercial vehicles fleet in the EU will meet this target for 2025 and more than meet the target for 2030. A CO2 reduction target of 100% for light commercial vehicles has been set for 2035. In the United Kingdom and Switzerland/Liechtenstein markets, the Volkswagen Group’s light commercial vehicle fleets met the statutory requirements for the reporting period. In Switzerland, the Volkswagen Group’s passenger car fleet fell just short of the statutory requirements for the reporting year. The CO2 pool established together with other manufacturers in the UK achieved its target.
