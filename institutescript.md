### **Script for the Institute Presentation**

#### **Part 1: Discovering the Hackathon (Speaker 1)**
*“Hackathons have always been an exciting challenge for us, and we actively participate in them to sharpen our skills and push boundaries. Our journey to Volkswagen I.mobilothon 4.0 began when we discovered it through platforms like Unstop and LinkedIn. These platforms have been invaluable for finding opportunities to showcase our innovative ideas. Having participated in multiple hackathons before, we were thrilled to tackle a competition organized by such a prestigious company. Each hackathon brings new learnings, and this one was no different—setting the stage for an unforgettable experience.”*

#### **Part 2: The Process and Challenges (Speaker 2)**  
*“We knew from the start that electric vehicles (EVs) are the future of sustainable transportation. However, their widespread adoption requires significant advancements in efficiency and performance. That’s where we wanted to make an impact. Our idea focused on improving EV battery efficiency and motor optimization. During the ideation process, we faced challenges like integrating diverse technologies, ensuring real-world feasibility, and aligning our solution with industry needs. But with determination and teamwork, we forged ahead, knowing the potential of our solution to bring EVs into the mainstream effectively.”*

#### **Part 3: Rounds and Competition (Speaker 3)**  
*“The hackathon was intense, with over 53,000 registrations and 3,000+ ideas submitted across India. From these, 800 were shortlisted for the prototype stage, and only 321 advanced further. We were fortunate to make it to the top 5 in the grand finale, where our solution was evaluated directly by Volkswagen's CEO and CTO. The competition had three rigorous rounds: idea submission with a detailed PPT, prototype development, and the grand finale. Each stage tested our innovation, technical skills, and problem-solving abilities, pushing us to deliver our best.”*

#### **Part 4: Introducing BEAM (Speaker 1)**  
*“Our project, BEAM—Battery Efficiency and AI Motor Optimization—stood out because of its unique approach. Under the expert guidance of Mr. Mahapatra, we combined metaheuristic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and large language models (LLMs). BEAM enhances battery performance through intelligent energy management, uses machine learning for predictive insights, and employs LLMs to analyze vast operational data. This real-time optimization ensures dynamic energy distribution, extends battery life, and boosts EV performance. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, we designed a comprehensive solution to revolutionize EV efficiency.”*

#### **Part 5: Simulation Results (Speaker 2)**  
*“In our closed-environment simulations, BEAM delivered exceptional results—achieving a 30% improvement in battery efficiency compared to generic approaches. This was a breakthrough that validated our hard work and innovative algorithms. These results demonstrated the potential of BEAM to transform the EV industry and address one of its biggest challenges: energy optimization. It wasn’t just a concept but a tested and proven solution.”*

#### **Part 6: The Reward and Recognition (Speaker 3)**  
*“Winning the I.mobilothon was a surreal experience. After the grand finale, we were invited to Volkswagen’s headquarters in Pune, where we presented our work to senior executives. They appreciated our vision and execution and recognized the potential of BEAM to impact the EV ecosystem. It was a proud moment when we were awarded and praised by the leadership team. This achievement not only validated our efforts but also inspired us to keep innovating for a sustainable future.”*
