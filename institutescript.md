### *Script for the Institute Presentation (Shortened Version)*


My name is Aakarshit srivastava, sitting to my right bhaskar banerjee and to my left ayush verma, we are team PERFECT CUBE and we are here to present our project BEAM : Battery Efficiency and AI Motor optimization.

#### *Part 1: Discovering the Hackathon (Speaker 1)*  
“Hackathons have always been a way for us to challenge ourselves and grow. We discovered Volkswagen I.mobilothon 4.0 through Unstop and LinkedIn, platforms we actively use to find such opportunities. With our past experiences in various hackathons, we were excited to tackle this challenge and bring our innovative ideas to the forefront.”

#### *Part 2: The Process and Challenges (Speaker 2)*  
“We focused on electric vehicles, knowing they are key to a sustainable future. Our challenge was to improve battery efficiency and motor performance to make EVs more mainstream. We worked hard to overcome technical hurdles and align our ideas with industry needs, staying committed to creating a real-world impact.”

---

#### *Part 3: Rounds and Competition (Speaker 3)*  
“The hackathon had over 53,000 registrations and 3,000+ ideas from across India. Only 321 prototypes made it to the finals, and we reached the top 5. It included three rounds: idea submission, prototype development, and the grand finale, where our solution was reviewed by Volkswagen’s CEO and CTO themselves.”

#### *Part 4: Introducing BEAM (Speaker 1)*  
“Our project, BEAM—Battery Efficiency and AI Motor Optimization—revolutionizes EV efficiency by combining metaheuristic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and large language models. Guided by Dr. Mahapatra’s expertise, we created an intelligent system that optimizes energy use, improves battery life, and enhances motor performance with real-time adjustments and predictive insights.”

---

#### *Part 5: Simulation Results (Speaker 2)*  
“BEAM delivered outstanding results, achieving a 30% improvement in battery efficiency during simulations compared to generic approaches. These results validated our hard work and demonstrated the potential of BEAM to revolutionize EV energy management.”

---

#### *Part 6: The Reward and Recognition (Speaker 3)*  
“Winning was a proud moment. We were invited to Volkswagen’s Pune headquarters, where senior executives appreciated our work. Being awarded and praised by industry leaders was a huge honor and motivates us to continue driving innovation for a sustainable future.”

---

#### *Closing Statement (All Together)*  
“This victory reflects the power of teamwork and innovation. We thank Volkswagen, our mentors, and our institute for their support in this journey toward a better tomorrow.”
